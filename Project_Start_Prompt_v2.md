Okay, here's an improved version of the "Zero-Code User Blueprint for SPARC Program Generation," incorporating the suggestions. The changes aim to elicit even more precise and useful information without significantly increasing the burden on the "Visionary."

---

**Welcome to the Zero-Code User Blueprint!**
This document will help you describe your program idea to **SPARC (System for Programmatic AI-driven Realization of Concepts)**, our AI-powered team of virtual coding assistants, who will then build it for you.

**Project Title:** (Give your program idea a simple name)
**Prepared By:** (Your Name)
**Date:** (Today's Date)

**Instructions for You (The Visionary!):**

*   **No Tech Jargon Needed!** Just describe your idea in plain English. Think about *what* you want the program to do and *why*, not *how* it does it technically.
*   **Be Detailed:** The more information and specific examples you give, the better the AI (SPARC) can understand and build exactly what you want. Imagine you're describing it to someone who needs to build it perfectly without asking you follow-up questions.
*   **Focus on the Goal:** What problem does this solve? What process does it make easier?
*   **Don't Worry About Code:** SPARC will figure out the best programming languages, databases, and technical stuff based on your description and its own research.

**Section 1: The Big Picture - What is this program all about?**

1.  **Elevator Pitch:** If you had 30 seconds to describe your program to a friend, what would you say? What's the main goal?
    *   Your Answer:
2.  **Problem Solver:** What specific problem does this program solve, or what task does it make much easier or better?
    *   Your Answer:
3.  **Why Does This Need to Exist?** What's the key benefit it offers? (e.g., saves time, saves money, organizes information, connects people, provides entertainment, etc.)
    *   Your Answer:

    *   Your Answer:
2.  **(Optional but helpful) User Persona Snippet:** Can you briefly describe a typical user? (e.g., "Marketing Mary, 35, overwhelmed by manual data entry, needs a tool to automate report generation.")
    *   Your Answer:
3.  **User Goals:** When someone uses your program, what are the top 1-3 things they want to accomplish with it? *What current frustrations or pain points will this program alleviate for them?*
    *   Example: For a recipe app, users might want to: 1. Find recipes quickly. 2. Save favorite recipes. 3. Create a shopping list. Current frustration: Too many complex recipe sites, hard to save and organize.

    *   Your Answer (List as many as needed):
        *
        *
        *
2.  **Key Feature Deep Dive:** Pick the MOST important feature from your list above. Describe step-by-step how you imagine someone using *that specific feature* from start to finish. What do they see? What do they click? What happens next? *(If it helps, feel free to sketch a very rough drawing of what this feature might look like at each step and describe your sketch. This is purely optional.)*

**Section 8: Success Criteria - How do we know it's perfect?**

1.  **Definition of Done:** Describe 3-5 simple scenarios. If the program handles these scenarios exactly as described, you'd consider it a success for that part. *(Consider including a scenario for what should happen if a user makes a common mistake – an 'unhappy path').*
    *   Example 1: "When I sign up with my email and password, I should get a confirmation email, and then be able to log in immediately."
    *   Example 2: "When I search for 'blue widgets,' it should show me only blue widgets, displaying their picture, name, and price."
    *   Example 3 (Unhappy Path): "If I try to log in with the wrong password three times, my account should be temporarily locked, and I should see a 'forgot password' link."
    *   Your Scenarios:
        *   1.
        *   2.

Once you submit this completed blueprint, the SPARC orchestration will take over. It will:

1.  Use **Deep Research** to analyze your vision, explore similar programs, investigate technical options, and fill in any knowledge gaps.
2.  Use the **Specification Writer** to turn your answers and the research into formal requirements.
3.  Use the **Architect** to design the system structure.
4.  Use **Code, TDD, Supabase Admin, MCP Integration,** and **Security Reviewer** modes iteratively to build, test, and secure the program based on the specifications and architecture.
5.  Use the **System Integrator** to connect all the pieces.
6.  Use the **Documentation Writer** to create guides.
7.  Use **DevOps** to set up infrastructure and deploy the application.
8.  Finally, it will present the completed, working program to you based on the Success Criteria you provided!
